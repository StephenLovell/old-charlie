This is the Index page. 

The look and feel of this page can be easily changed by altering the 'index.ms' template file. In order to do so it is recommended that you first clone the default template located in 'app/themes/' into the root 'themes' directory (or create your own). 

Any changes you make to the default theme located in 'app/themes/' may be overwritten during updates. Generally, its best not to modify Core.

Once you've setup your new theme (make sure it isn't named 'default', that's a reserved name) you'll need to tell Charlie to use your theme by setting it in the 'config.ini' file. Simply set the 'theme' option to the folder name of your theme. Remember, theme directory names cannot have spaces.
